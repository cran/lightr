\title{Extract spectral data from spectra files}
\usage{
lr_get_spec(
  where = getwd(),
  ext = "txt",
  lim = c(300, 700),
  decimal = ".",
  sep = NULL,
  subdir = FALSE,
  subdir.names = FALSE,
  cores = getOption("mc.cores", 2L),
  ignore.case = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{where}{Folder in which files are located (defaults to current working
directory).}

\item{ext}{File extension to be searched for, without the "."
(defaults to \code{txt}).}

\item{lim}{A vector with two numbers determining the wavelength limits to be
considered (defaults to \code{c(300, 700)}).}

\item{decimal}{Character to be used to identify decimal plates
(defaults to \code{.}).}

\item{sep}{Column delimiting characters to be considered in addition to the
default (which are: tab, space, and ";")}

\item{subdir}{Should subdirectories within the \code{where} folder be included in
the search? (defaults to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{subdir.names}{Should subdirectory path be included in the name of the
spectra? (defaults to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to be used. If greater than 1, import will use
parallel processing (not available in Windows).}

\item{ignore.case}{Should the extension search be case insensitive? (defaults
to \code{TRUE})}
}
\value{
A data.frame, containing the wavelengths in the first column and
individual imported spectral files in the subsequent columns.
Reflectance values are interpolated to the nearest wavelength integer.
}
\description{
Finds and imports reflectance/transmittance/absorbance data from spectra
files in a given location.

\examples{
lr_get_spec(system.file("testdata", package = "lightr"), ext = "jdx")
